# website

This repository contains files that are used to build my little website. You can check it out at http://mbrueckner.herokuapp.com/
The website is created using flask and is hosted via heroku. Flask is a python framework that can easily be installed using: pip install flask
It combines a couple of projects Ive been working on.

If you want to run it locally yourself you can download the repository and start it by executing the runwebsite.py script with: python runwebsite.py
